Demonstration program of the AcousticAVE library with Qt5 and VTK graphics library.

SETUP

1) Copy a room model file, in Wavefront .OBJ format, to the Geometry folder. Load it calling aave_read_obj().

2) Copy one or more anechoic sounds, in 16-bit mono 44100Hz raw format, to the Sounds folder. Set their paths in the sources[] array.

3) Initialize volume, area and rt60, room geometry and the hrtf set before calling aave_init().

BUILD

GNU/Linux

Uses the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture library (libasound)
for sound output and thus is compatible with both Qt4 and Qt5.

1) Install libvtk5.8-qt4 package and all associated packages to build qvtk apps.


1) Edit demo.pro and uncomment the line appropriate for your CPU
#LIBS += -Lisense -lisense64
#LIBS += -Lisense -lisense32

2) Build the program:

- Update CMakeLists.txt with the correct paths.

- Use CMake to create a makefile.

- Execute make.

3) Edit isports.ini and edit the name of the device connected to the sensor
Example: Port1 = /dev/ttyUSB0

4) Set the library path to include the isense directory
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/isense

5) Run the program
$ ./demo_qvtk
