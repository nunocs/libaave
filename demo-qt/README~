SETUP

1) Copy a room model file, in Wavefront .OBJ format, to model.obj.

2) Copy an anechoic sound, in 16-bit mono 44100Hz raw format, to source.raw

BUILD

GNU/Linux

Uses the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture library (libasound)
for sound output and thus is compatible with both Qt4 and Qt5.

1) Edit demo.pro and uncomment the line appropriate for your CPU
#LIBS += -Lisense -lisense64
#LIBS += -Lisense -lisense32

2) Build the program
$ qmake
$ make

3) Edit isports.ini and edit the name of the device connected to the sensor
Example: Port1 = /dev/ttyUSB0

4) Set the library path to include the isense directory
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/isense

5) Run the program
$ ./demo

Windows

Uses the Qt multimedia module and thus requires Qt5.

1) Edit demo.pro and uncomment the line appropriate for your CPU
#LIBS += -Lisense -lisense64
#LIBS += -Lisense -lisense32

2) Build the program
> qmake
> mingw32-make

3) Copy the appropriate dll to the program's directory
> copy isense\isense32.dll isense.dll
> copy isense\isense64.dll isense.dll

4) Edit isports.ini and edit the name of the device connected to the sensor
Example: Port1 = COM13

5) Run the program
> release\demo
